We'll define these core operations inside main.py as we move code from notebooks to the appropriate scripts below:

elt_data: extract, load and transform data.
optimize: tune hyperparameters to optimize for objective.
train_model: train a model using best parameters from optimization study.
load_artifacts: load trained artifacts from a given run.
predict_tag: predict a tag for a given input.
